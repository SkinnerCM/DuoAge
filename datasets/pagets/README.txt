Title	Epigenetic analysis of Pagetâ€™s disease of bone identifies differentially methylated loci that predict disease status
Organism	Homo sapiens
Experiment type	Methylation profiling by array
Summary	This study demonstrated that PDB has an epigenetic signature in the blood and that differentially methylated sites in white blood cells may be used as predictive markers of the disease. Many of the identified changes in DNA methylation were associated with genes that regulate osteoclast function, immune responses, host reponse to viral infection, pain pathways and pathways involved in mechanosensing.
 	
Overall design	The study was conducted in 253 cases with clinical and radiological evidence of PDB and 280 controls who were spouses of PDB cases (n=135) or subjects who had been referred for investigation of osteoporosis but had normal bone density upon examination by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (n=131)
