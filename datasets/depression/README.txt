Title	Epigenome analysis of depressed and control subjects.
Organism	Homo sapiens
Experiment type	Methylation profiling by genome tiling array
Summary	Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of depressed (n=489) and control subjects (n=210) that were recruited at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry (MPIP). The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles based whole blood samples.
 	
Overall design	Bisulphite converted DNA from the 699 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human methylation Beadchip .
