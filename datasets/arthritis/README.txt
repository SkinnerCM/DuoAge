Title	Differential DNA methylation in Rheumatoid arthritis
Organism	Homo sapiens
Experiment type	Methylation profiling by array
Summary	Genome-wide DNA methylation level was studied to determine whether Rheumatoid arthritis patients (cases) has methylation differences comparing to normal controls in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs).
We used Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array to determine the genome-wide DNA methylation difference in PBLs from Rheumatoid arthritis patients (cases) and normal controls
 	
Overall design	Bisulphite converted DNA from the Rheumatoid arthritis patients (cases) and normal controls were hybridized to the Illumina Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays
