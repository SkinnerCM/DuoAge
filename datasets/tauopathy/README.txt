Title	An Epigenetic Signature in Peripheral Blood Associated with Neurodegenerative Tauopathy and the Risk-Associated Haplotype on 17q21.31
Organism	Homo sapiens
Experiment type	Methylation profiling by genome tiling array
Summary	Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are two neurodegenerative diseases linked, at the pathologic and genetic level, to the macrutubule associated protein tau. We identified and replicated a dose-dependent effect of the risk-associated H1 haplotype on methylation levels within the region in independent datasets in blood and brain. These data reveal that the H1 haplotype increases risk for tauopathy via differential methylation, indicating a mediating role for methylation in dementia pathophysiology.
 	
Overall design	We studied epigenetic changes (DNA methylation levels) in peripheral blood from patients with PSP, FTD, and unaffected controls. Analysis of genome-wide methylation patterns revealed significant differentially methylated probes in patients versus unaffected controls.
