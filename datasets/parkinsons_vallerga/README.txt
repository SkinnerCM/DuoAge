Title	Epigenome analysis of Parkinson's disease and control samples from the Systema Genomics Parkinson's disease (SGPD) consortium
Organism	Homo sapiens
Experiment type	Methylation profiling by genome tiling array
Summary	Genome wide DNA methylation association analysis of Parkinson's disease and control samples. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in blood samples. Samples included 1001 Parkinson's disease cases and 973 controls.
 	
Overall design	Bisulphite converted DNA from the 1974 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip. 85 samples failed QC and so were not included in the final dataset.
